to help cracking the polynomial you should:  
- compile the project  
- run `./crc-comunist-9000`  
- profit  

you can ctrl+c to stop the program and it'll save the progress to a save.bin file  
it also saves every 0xFFFF entries in case of a power loss or program termination  
when the hash is found the program will terminate and the result is the poly.bin file
